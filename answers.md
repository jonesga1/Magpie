 • What happens when more than one keyword appears in a string? Consider the string “My mother has a dog but no cat.” Explain how to prioritize responses in the reply method.

 If statment will check which keyword comes first in the if statment. So in this case it checks for 'mother' before 'dog', so it will put the response for mother first. To prioritize simply organize the if statements in a proper order.

 Question
1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the responses to these statements.

The code will read all characters and see where a keyword appears, even if it's inside another word. So in this case it will see the no in know. This of course gives a response which makes no sense in context, which is bad.
